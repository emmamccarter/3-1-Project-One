# 3-1-Project-One

Artemis Financial wants to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. They want to make sure they can protect against any external threats. Their vulnerabilites were easy to spot and quick action to was taken to ensure the highest level of security. Code security is so important because external threats will always be present and new measures must be taken as hackers become more skilled. The vulnerability was tedious but not necessarily challenging. Mitigation techniques should always be chosen based on the users requirements. With numerous checks, in order to ensure the code and software appliation were function and secure, vulnerability checks were taken throughout the coding process. From this assignment I would show case my ability to use the vulnerability assessment and apply that to any project I am working on.
